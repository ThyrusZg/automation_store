## How to start test cases

- Navigate to the project terminal
- If you want to execute test cases without seeing execution you can simply type ''pytest'''
- If you want to see execution ''pytest --headed --slowmo 500''' (slowmo will slow down execution, so it can be noticed)
- Note* : In order to execute tests with pytest it is common practise that all test start with "test_"
